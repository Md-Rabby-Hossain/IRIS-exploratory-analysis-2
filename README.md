The project includes **boxplots, scatter plots, and median analysis** to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal features for all Iris species.

If you want, I can also **write a ready-to-use folder structure with placeholders** for:  
- `data/` → your CSV  
- `plots/` → screenshots  
- `scripts/` → Python code
